# Inspire
## Description

For this project, I created a social app that aims to turn bad days into good days through motivational inspiration. Sometimes the worst days can be corrected with something simple: something as small as a quote. At Inspire, we provide motivational quotes from some of the most influential people in history to try and cheer users up.
